Hiya! If you're reading this, you've most likely found my Pokémon FireRed mod somewhere.

LynnMod (I'm amazing with names) is a rebalance mod that aims to make every Pokémon at least useable in a regular playthrough. To achieve this, I've looked at every Pokémon and considered its moveset, stats, typing, and ability. 

All Pokémon should be available. No more dealing with version exclusives.

Some weak Pokémon (think of Pokémon like Onix) have seen quite an improvement in their base stat total, but for most Pokémon the stats have been shuffled around a little to better match their gameplan. 

Movesets have been updated to always give reliable STAB options, generally paired with normal-type attacks and utility moves. You should end up in situations where you have to wait tens of levels for good moves less often now.

TMs have had their focus shifted from powerful moves (Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam) to support-oriented moves (with a few exceptions related to gym leader TMs). Generally, you'll find that TMs are no longer required to give a Pokémon good offensive moves. Instead, they exist to solve specific problems you might run into for individual trainers.

All move tutors have been removed. At the location of some move tutors, you'll find a TM instead.

Some abilities have been changed to make a little more sense. This means that a few Pokémon have gained levitate. The "activate on contact 30% of the time" abilities have been removed. No more Poison Point, Static, Flame Body, Effect Spore, or Cute Charm.

With the gen 1-remakes having poor type distribution, some Pokémon have had their types changed. There are additional Ghost, Dragon, and Dark types in Kanto now. Magnemite and Magneton are still the only steel types.

To aid in the expansion of movesets, this mod has the physical/special split. A few moves from later generations have been backported to add good physical/special moves for some types. I've also added a handful of custom moves to add to the fun a little.

Items are much easier to get now. There are various berry merchants throughout Kanto, and (almost) all held items are readily available as well.

The rival, elite four, and gym leaders have gotten tired of being beaten by a 10-year-old. They've upgraded their strategies, and are ready to brawl.

To install this mod, you will need a Pokémon FireRed rom (US version). I cannot help you with this. Once you have acquired your rom, you can download IPS patch and install the mod with an IPS patcher.

This mod is a personal project I do in my spare time that lives and breathes. Therefore, it's liable to change based on my personal whims. Any feedback, bug report or otherwise, is welcome!
